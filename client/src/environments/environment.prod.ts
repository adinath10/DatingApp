export const environment = {
  production: true,

// ng serve --prod

// when you did ng serve --prod angular cli make a production build with tree shaking and 
// AOT (Ahead Of Time) compilation and generate less code compare to normal build. 
// You also run in local what it will be like in prod mode

// disadvantage is it is less debuggable as its compiled and minified code
